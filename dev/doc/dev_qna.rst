Is the SEEK-ID(json) persistent?
================================
- Answered on 03.09.2020 by SO
    - SEEK-id and version (i.e. https://fairdomhub.org/models/20.json?version=1) is bound to domain name
        - domain change â†’ force recreate DB
    - the uuid is persistent

Are SEEK-ids reused?
====================
- Answered on 03.09.2020 by SO
- question was: Is it in any case possible, that Model Y gets the ID of a deleted Model X? (database reorganisation)
    - no, the ID stays unique, new models get the next free, never before used ID
